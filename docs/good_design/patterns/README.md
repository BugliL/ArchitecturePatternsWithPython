# Patterns

There are many patterns that can be used to achieve a good design. Here there are the patterns presented in the book `Architecture Patterns with Python` by Harry Percival and Bob Gregory.

- [Repository](./repository.md) - Abstraction on persistent storage
- [Service layer](./service_layer.md) - use case boundary
- [Unit of work](./unit_of_work.md) - atomic operations
- **Aggregate pattern** - enforce data integrity
